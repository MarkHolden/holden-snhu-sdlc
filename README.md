# Software Development Lifecycle
by Mark Holden

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The first thing to do when you recieve requirements is to make your requirements less dumb. It doesn't matter who gave them to you, your requirements are definietly dumb, and we should strive to make them less dumb. User stories are a way to make the requirements less dumb because the story itself can shine a light on a potentially dumb requirement.

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs in whatever way makes the most sense for the particular project, team, and the company as a whole. If an agile process makes sense, then I will use that, but if it does not make sense, then hope is not an effective strategy to incorporate it. My guess is that all companies that I work for in the future will be some flavor of agile, as have the software companies I have worked at in the past. Each company has a different process, and if I see a way to streamline something I will suggest it whether it falls into the agile methodology or not.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
In my opinon a good team member in software development is the same as a good team member on any other team. You take personal ownership of the success of the team and do whatever you are capable of doing to unsure that outcome. This includes things like asking questions when you are not sure about something, encouraging other team members, and teaching and mentoring to help others grow.
